//* Store your questions as an array of objects in a separate file, `questions.js`, that follows this format: ```js//

var questions = [
  {
    title: "Commonly used data types DO NOT include:",
    choices: ["strings", "booleans", "alerts", "numbers"],
    answer: "alerts"
  },
  {
    title: "The condition in an if / else statement is enclosed within ____.",
    choices: ["quotes", "curly brackets", "parentheses", "square brackets"],
    answer: "parentheses"
  },
  ///etc.
];

//* The length of the array in `questions.js` determines the length of play. Fifteen seconds per question is a good estimate, so 5 questions will result in a length of play of 75 seconds.//
